## Building a line chart using Svelte and D3
This repository refers to an article published on Medium where I explain how to build an interactive line chart using Svelte and D3.
To use these files, just install a Svelte project on your computer and replace the files in the src folder with mine, install D3 and run everything.
A working preview of the chart can be found [here](http://steflyx.com/lineChartSvelte/).
